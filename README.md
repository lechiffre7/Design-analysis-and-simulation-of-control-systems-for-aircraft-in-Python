# Design-analysis-and-simulation-of-control-systems-for-aircraft-in-Python
Develop a modeling and simulation framework using Python to analyze and verify the design of aircraft flight control systems (FCS) using system algebra formal methods. The goal is to demonstrate the capability of system algebra to assess system properties like availability, redundancy, coupling and fault tolerance.
